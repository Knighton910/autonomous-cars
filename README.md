# So what i'm trying to do is a Corporation that dispatch driverless cars
# and this place also have charging ports

so what i need to do is take what i learned from teamtreehouse working on 
 the corporation intranet an apply it for this driverless car company, i was thinking of 
 doing spaceships and mission ready spacepods, but as of now, i'm gonna model this
 after what we did at treehouse, I'm still not finished with that.
 but of now, i'm gonna do this, just to iron out the wrinkles and when i learn
 more at treehouse project come back and finish off this driverless car company project.
